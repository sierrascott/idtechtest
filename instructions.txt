These are instructions on how to use an IDE to view your webpage

1. Have a web browser open while you work in your IDE
2. In your IDE, right click on your index.html file and select "Copy Full Path"
3. Open a new page in your web browser
4. Paste the full path in the url bar of your web browser

This will pull up your webpage that is hosted locally on your computer (it's not
a real webpage yet)

5. Whenever you make changes in your IDE code, be sure to save
6. After saving, you can reload/ refresh the page in your web browser to see
any changes
